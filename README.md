🏦 Loan Approval Prediction

🔹About

The Loan Approval Prediction project aims to streamline the process of evaluating bank loan applications by employing Machine Learning techniques. Using historical application data, the model assesses key applicant attributes and provides a real-time approval probability, helping financial organizations make faster and more informed decisions.

🔹Features

Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use, interactive application — no coding knowledge required.

Data-Driven: Model trained on historical banking data to provide reliable and accurate predictions.

Scalable: Design allows for future expansion, adding more variables or swapping models.

Customizable: Features, algorithms, and scoring criteria can be fine-tuned or upgraded with ease.

🔹Tech Stack

Python
Scikit-Learn: Logistic Regression (Classification Model)

Streamlit: UI framework for lightweight and interactive applications

Pandas, Numpy: Data manipulation and processing

Jupyter Notebook: Model development and evaluation

Joblib/Pickle: Model and scaler persistence

🔹Acknowledgements

The model is trained on a publicly available banking dataset. The application is powered by Streamlit, pandas, scikit-learn, and joblib.
